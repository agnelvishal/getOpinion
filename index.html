Have an email you're too nervous to send?
Send it to me first at agnelvishal@gmail.com or message here, and I'll reply within 12 hours pretending to be the intended recipient.

This is just a game to help you send that message you have always delayed.

It could be a business proposal, love letter to your crush or a hate mail.

All emails are 100% confidential. Send me a hello mail and I will send you a image of handwritten text specifying that the interaction will be private, with my signature and your mail id.
